# HazelWeb
Repository of PHP and Javascript code for the HAZEL web front-end

### Some notes on the repository:
*We do not include libraries from other sources with our code. You shuld be able to obtain the required libraries from their respective vendors.*
* There should be a `vendor` directory (at the highest level) and it should contain a folder (with code), `Mobile-Detect`, which is the latest download from [Mobile Detect](http://mobiledetect.net) with the version number removed.
* There should also be a `js/vendor` directory and it should contain the following:
  * a file, `modernizr.js`, from [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) with the version info removed.
  * The directory and code subtrees of the Dojo Toolkit from [Dojo Toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org):
    * `dijit`
    * `dojo`
    * `dojox`
